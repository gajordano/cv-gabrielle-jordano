            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">I'm a diverse person who loves to face challenges. The years of experience in commerce and in the development of my businesses have trained my mind to automatically seek solutions and find simple, agile ways to solve problems. 
            </p>    
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">I'm from São Paulo, Brazil and currently live in Seinäjoki, Southern Ostrobothnia in Finland. Today I'm studying programming languages, starting with JavaScript, so that I can carry out projects and talk in more depth about technological projects.
            </p>
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">I was a trader for 16 years and a businesswoman for over 20 years. I have a degree in Tourism, with a postgraduate degree in Sustainable Tourism from SENAC.
            </p>
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">I'm the founder of 2 Tourism Startups, Integratur a Tourism Startup aimed at the Disabled and 60+ Public that provides accessible places according to the type of disability. And Fusion Integrate, a platform for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs in the tourism sector to recognize their enterprise and have access to techniques and technologies for rapid and sustainable growth of the company.</p>
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">I like to travel and get to know new cultures, places, smells and sensations. One of my passions is gastronomy in which I can get to know a little of the history and habits through the palate. Being outdoors, whether doing some physical activity, reading a book or simply enjoying the moment and sounds of nature. Reading books, watching movies and series and even some Brazilian soap operas are part of my favorite pastime. </p>

            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">Volunteering, in addition to passion, is my purpose. Even at a distance, I continue to teach and mentor small entrepreneurs who are starting their journeys.</p>
